#DingConnect Demo — International Mobile Top-Up Flow (Blazor)

A modern end-to-end demo application that simulates an international mobile top-up experience, inspired by real-world telecom aggregation platforms.

This project focuses on clean architecture, real API integration patterns, and user-centric flow design, while intentionally operating in demo / validation mode only.

##✨What This Project Demonstrates

This application showcases how a real top-up platform works from start to finish:

Country & Mobile Number Input

Automatic Provider Detection

Available Top-Up Plans Retrieval

Checkout & Transfer Validation

Clear Success / Failure Feedback

All flows are implemented with production-grade structure, while avoiding real money transfers.

##🧠Key Design Principles

Safety first
No real transactions are executed. All transfers use validation-only mode.

Real-world logic
Provider matching, product selection, and transfer validation follow actual telecom rules.

Separation of concerns
UI, business logic, API integration, and state management are clearly separated.

Future-proof
The project is structured so UI or API layers can evolve independently.
